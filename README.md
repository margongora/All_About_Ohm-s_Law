About the project:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This program uses Object-Oriented Programming, as well as the tkinter module from Python3, to create a
small web app, designed to present the information about Ohm's Law in a short and easy format to read.
You can learn about the three components of Ohm's Law individually, or see how their presence affects
each other in proportional ways.
